The project consists of an HTML file that sets up the structure of the image gallery, including a top bar titled "Gallery," a container for images, and navigation buttons for moving between images. The CSS file styles the layout, ensuring the gallery is visually appealing and responsive. The gallery container has a fixed width with overflow hidden to display one image at a time. Transition effects are added to the images for smooth navigation. The JavaScript file handles the functionality, allowing users to navigate through the images using the next and previous buttons. It updates the image display by adjusting the CSS transform property based on the current index, creating a sliding effect for the gallery.
